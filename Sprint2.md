## Second Sprint Meeting

Mission: We need to narrow down our calendar application to target at a specific group of users.

Obstacle: Whether we should target our users at students in UCD like suggested by Professor King in our proposal. If we 
import(scrape) the data from schedule builder, would it be legal? (Need to discuss that with our mentor)

Tasks: Finalize our decision on the choice of application features in detail. Finalize our UI. Acquire the needed calendar api 
from the Internet and test their functionality. Implement the reminider(alarm) feature
